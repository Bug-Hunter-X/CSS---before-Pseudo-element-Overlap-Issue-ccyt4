The solution uses `background-image` directly on the `div` element instead of relying on the `::before` pseudo-element. This approach provides a simpler and more reliable way to add the background image without the risk of z-index conflicts:

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
}
```

Alternatively, if for any reason using a `::before` is required, consider using a higher `z-index` value with careful management to ensure correct stacking order. This may also require adjustments to the HTML structure to avoid conflicts.
