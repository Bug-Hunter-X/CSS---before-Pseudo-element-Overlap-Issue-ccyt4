# CSS ::before Pseudo-element Overlap Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving the use of the `::before` pseudo-element in CSS.  The issue arises when attempting to add a background image using `::before` while maintaining the correct stacking order with other elements.  The provided `bug.css` file shows the buggy implementation.  The solution, presented in `bugSolution.css`, resolves this problem by addressing the z-index and potentially other layout issues.

## Problem
The main problem is that even with `z-index: -1;`, the background image sometimes overlaps the main content, depending on the browser and the structure of the HTML. 

## Solution
The solution involves changing how the `position` is handled, potentially using a technique that avoids absolute positioning, or using a different approach to layer the elements.
